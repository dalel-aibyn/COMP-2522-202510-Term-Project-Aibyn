## Any important comments you'd like to make about your work:
This project didn’t turn out exactly how I first imagined it.

Balancing between multiple term projects, general burnout, and just a lack of ideas made it hard to work consistently on this.

I still gave it a shot and tried to put something together that at least partially met the requirements.

Also, I just used a single commit to push the final version once everything was working, and I was happy with it. I know that’s not great version control practice, but since I was working solo, it felt fine for how I was managing things.

It’s far from what I imagined when I started, but I'm not dissatisfied with this end result, it's pretty actually fun.

Thank you for understanding.
